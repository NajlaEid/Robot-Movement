# Robot-Movement
The web page allows users to control the movement of a robot by inputting arrow distances and displays the movement of the robot through arrows of corresponding sizes.
###A robot's movement is controlled by the user entering arrow distances size, and arrows represent the robot's movement. When a user clicks the "Submit" button for an arrow direction, the corresponding arrow with a size based on the distance the user provides is displayed on the web page. The arrows are built using CSS border attributes. PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS were used to develop the website.
